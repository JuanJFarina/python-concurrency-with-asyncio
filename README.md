# Python concurrency with asyncio

This repository is meant for practicing the different examples and topics shown through Matthew Fowler's book.

Not all code shown in the book is present here, and some has been modified by me to play around a bit and get a better understanding of the topic being covered.

Comments are also added in many places as a fast reminder of what was being taught at that moment.

You can also find summaries at the end of each chapter, which serve as a small glimpse of what was learned.
